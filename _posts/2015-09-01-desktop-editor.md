Today we're happy to announce that our editor is now available on the desktop, you can [download it here](http://downloads.editor.gitbook.com) !

It ships with all the great features you've come to love with our web editor and integrates beautifully with [GitBook.com](https://www.gitbook.com). So give it a try and let us know what you think !

## Write online, offline, everywhere

Our editor works offline so you can write on trains, planes or simply at home without the distractions of the modern web. You can create, edit and manage local books and it takes no more than a single click to pull in a book from GitBook.com and only one more to sync your changes back.

## Automatic updates

Thanks to automatic updates, you'll always have the best and latest features on all platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux and the web.

All new features available in the web editor will also be available on the desktop.

## Moving forward

A lot of work in this release went into improving our build and development process so shipping new releases takes no more than a couple of minutes.

This will allow us to iterate quickly for future releases and get awesome features in your hands ASAP.
