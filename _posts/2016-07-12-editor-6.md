We are delighted to release version 6 of the GitBook Editor today!

<!-- more -->

Our focus was to improve productivity and overall stability.

### What you see, is what you mean

This is the core feature of the new Editor. We have been working hard to remove the preview and make editing documents seamless and beautiful.

### Smarter

#### Links auto-completion

How tiring it was to type the paths to files when creating summary entries or links. Now it is so smooth. Thanks to auto-completion, you can swiftly link to files, or articles in your book.

#### Automatic files management

We made our best to spare you from managing the book's files yourself. Now you can forget about files and focus on your content. Files are created automatically as you create articles and images are organised into an `assets` folder. You can still browse the files tree from the menu, but it should rarely be necessary.

### Support for GitBook v3

For those of you who did not know yet, the GitBook format progressed to version 3 recently, bringing along some cool new features. The new Editor will allow you to make use of them!

#### Anchor links

You can now make links pointing to some heading of your page. They are called anchor links. You can use them in Markdown `\(Some anchor link\)\[file.md#name-of-the-heading\]`. Or you can let the Editor suggest them for the current article:

#### Parts

You can create parts to organize your articles. Parts serve to divide your articles into high-level groups

#### Theming

GitBook v3 introduced themes for books. Some of them, like the [theme FAQ](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/theme-faq), rely on features only supported in the new Editor.

#### Improved stability and performances

The `gitbook` library itself was integrated to the new Editor, and is used to parse files and generate previews. This has led to better performances overall, less bugs, and less difference between what you see in the Editor and what is published on GitBook.com in the end.

### How to get it?

You can grab the new release through the auto-updater on Windows and Mac; or [download it](https://www.gitbook.com/editor) for Linux. The Web version is already live on GitBook.com.

Thanks for your continued feedback and support ! Let us know what you would like to see in the next release !
