We are delighted to release version 6 of the GitBook Editor today!

<!-- more -->

Our focus was to improve productivity and overall stability.

### What you see, is what you mean

This is the core feature of the new Editor. We have been working hard to remove the preview and make editing documents seamless and beautiful.

### Smarter

#### Links auto-completion

How tiring it was to type the paths to files when creating summary entries or links. Now it is so smooth. Thanks to auto-completion, you can swiftly link to files, or articles in your book.

#### Automatic files management

We made our best to spare you from managing the book's files yourself. Now you can forget about files and focus on your content. Files are created automatically as you create articles and images are organised into an `assets` folder. You can still browse the files tree from the menu, but it should rarely be necessary.
